# Summary
The MATLAB program calculates the excess pore water and air pressures during the consolidation process of unsaturated soils. It is based on the governing equations proposed for the consolidation of unsaturated soils by Fredlund and Hasan (1979). For further reference, please refer to Zhou et al. (2014).
