# Summary
This algorithm contains Python code samples for the unpublish paper “A Rigorous Random Field-based Framework for 3D Stratigraphic Uncertainty Modelling”. The program computes the stratigraphic uncertainty between discrete borehole data and provides a 3D voxel-based entropy model. The code is written for Python 3.8.8. The data sample will be available after the paper is published.
