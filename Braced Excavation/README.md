# Summary
The MATLAB program updates the uncertain parameters in the BEFM using field observations. The updated parameters can then be used to predict wall deflection for subsequent excavation stages in braced excavations. This is a realization of the study related to the published paper "A beam on elastic foundation method for predicting deflection of braced excavations considering uncertainties" and an important reference for the paper under review called "An efficient physics-guided Bayesian framework for predicting ground settlement profile during excavations in clay".
